# Automated Postman Collection Runner

This Node.js script automates the execution of a Postman collection for each row of data in an Excel file, generating HTML reports for each run.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

```bash
# Install required packages
npm install postman-runtime xlsx newman
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automated-postman-runner.git
cd automated-postman-runner
```

2. Place your Excel file with data and Postman collection JSON file in the appropriate paths.

```bash
# Modify the paths in the script
const excelFilePath = 'path/to/your/excel/file.xlsx';
const postmanCollectionPath = 'path/to/your/postman/collection.json';
const htmlReportOutputPath = 'path/to/output/report.html';
```

3. Run the script.

```bash
node automated-postman-runner.js
```

The script will iterate over each row in the Excel file, run the Postman collection, and generate an HTML report for each run.

## Configuration

- **excelFilePath:** Path to the Excel file containing data.
- **postmanCollectionPath:** Path to the Postman collection JSON file.
- **htmlReportOutputPath:** Path to the directory where HTML reports will be saved.

## Notes

- Modify the script to customize collection variables or request data based on the current row.

Feel free to customize the script and adapt it to your specific use case.
